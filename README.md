## CRopt (CNN-RNN based codon optmization)  
This is codon optimization tool based on CNN-RNN model. The architecture can be used for any genome with little bit of expermenting epochs, here we have given pre-trained model for ecoli k-12 genome. 

# usage  
Run CRopt.ipynb for Codon optimization under tools folder.
